## 🎯 **Smart Event Organizer API – Project Purpose**

This system serves as the **backend engine** for an event management platform, where users can **create, manage who is attending, discover, and RSVP (respond) to events (**like tech meetups, workshops, classes, etc.**).**

What the API Will Handle 

## what the API Will Handle

### 1. User Management

- Register and log in users
- Authenticate users using JWT
- Assign Permissions (e.g. only event creators can edit/delete their events)

### 2. Event Management

- Let authenticated users **create**, **view**, **update**, and **delete** events.
- Store event details:
    - Title, description
    - Location (physical or online)
    - Start and end date/time
    - Category (Tech, Education, Health, etc.)
- Filter and search through events (e.g. by date or category)

### 🎭 3. **RSVP System:**

RSVP stand for “ Répondez s’il vous plait” — it means “Please respond” in French. in events, it means: “**Are you coming or not?”**

### 🎯 In Your API, RSVP Means:

Users can tell the system whether they will attend a specific event.

## 🧩How It Works in the API:

Let’s say you have an event:

**Event**: “ ****Python Workshop ”

Users can respond with one of the following:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `going` | Yes, I will attend |
| `maybe` | I might attend |
| `declined` | No, I won’t attend |

[Example](https://www.notion.so/Example-244a7d130d22806fa74ef5e9b3cc1e6d?pvs=21)

## 👀 What Can Users Do with RSVP?

| Action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| RSVP to an event | Create a new response (`going`, etc.) |
| Change RSVP | Update their response |
| View their RSVPs | See which events they responded to |
| See attendees (if owner) | Check who RSVP’d for your event |

### 📃 4. **API Features That Show Professional Skill**

- JWT-based authentication
    - **What it means**: Users must log in to access protected parts of your API.
    - **How**: You use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to keep users securely logged in.
    - **Why it matters**: Every modern API uses token-based login systems. This shows you understand secure authentication.
- DRF ViewSets + Routers
    - **What it means**: You use Django REST Framework’s tools to make your API cleaner and faster to build.
    - **How**: Instead of writing separate views for GET, POST, etc., you use a `ViewSet`, and DRF handles the routing.
    - **Why it matters**: It saves time, reduces code duplication, and follows best practices.
- Pagination, Filtering, and Searching
    - **What it means**:
        - **Pagination**: Shows a few items at a time (like 10 events per page)
        - **Filtering**: Narrow results (e.g., events in “Tech” category only)
        - **Searching**: Let users search by title or keyword
    - **Why it matters**: Real apps don’t return 1000 items at once — users need to find what they’re looking for easily.
- Custom permissions (e.g., only the owner can delete their event)
    - **What it means**: You control **who can do what**.
    - **Example**: Only the person who created the event can update or delete it.
    - **Why it matters**: It keeps your app secure and fair. Without permissions, anyone could change anything.
- Relational data (foreign keys for category, RSVP, etc.)
    - **What it means**: Your models are connected using **ForeignKeys**.
    - **Example**:
        - Each **event** is connected to a **user** (creator).
        - Each **RSVP** is connected to both a **user** and an **event**.
    - **Why it matters**: This shows you understand how to design a real database structure, not just flat tables.
- 📚 **API documentation**
    - **What it means**: You write documentation to explain how your API works.
    - **How**: You can use tools like **Swagger** or **Postman collections** to automatically generate API docs.
    - **Why it matters**: Developers expect documentation. It makes your project look polished and easy to use.

## 🖼️ Example User Flows

### 👤 *As a User:*

- I can sign up, log in, and see a list of upcoming events.
- I can RSVP to events I want to attend.
- I can cancel or update my RSVP status.

### 👨‍💼 *As an Organizer:*

- I can create events and assign them to categories.
- I can edit or delete only my own events.
- I can view RSVPs and prepare based on attendance.

## 🧩 Why It’s a Great Capstone

| Feature | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication | Shows you understand security & user roles |
| CRUD operations | Core of any API system |
| Relationships (user → event → RSVP) | Demonstrates database modeling |
| Filtering & Pagination | Helps with scalable API design |
| Documentation & testing | Real-world readiness |
